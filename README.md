# Choosing Seattle Airbnbs
The exploratory analysis of Airbnb data gives valuable insight for selecting an ideal Seattle Airbnb.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with the Anaconda distribution of Python and Python versions 3.* . Make sure you install the necessary libraries -- pandas and matplotlib.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data from 2016 to 2017 to better understand:

1. What neighborhoods have the highest review scores?
2. What property types have the highest review scores?
3. Does cleanliness play a role in the overall review score?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook to display work related to the inquiries. The notebook is exploratory, giving enough insight to make confident decisions in Airbnb stays. Markdown cells were used to separate the questions and steps. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@nicoleath/selecting-a-seattle-stay-600a21b2ef5f).
